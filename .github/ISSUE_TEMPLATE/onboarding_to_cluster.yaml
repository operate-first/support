          label: Team name
          description: |
              Your team name should be a short identifier consisting of lower
              case letters, numbers, and dashes (technically, anything thing
              satisfies [RFC 1123](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names)). For example, `widget-research` is a
              valid team name, but `Widget Research` is not, because it contains
              whitespace.

              We will use this name to create an OpenShift `group` for you and
              your team members.

              You need to pick a "team name" whether or not you are requesting
              access for a group of people or an individual. We recommend that
              you do not use your individual name as a team name.

          description: |
              Resources in OpenShift are contained in "namespaces" (also called
              "projects"). Unless you request otherwise, we will create a single
              project for you with the same name as your selected team name.

              If you need additional namespaces, or want a project name that
              differs from your team name, please indicate that here. Project
              names have the same requirements as team names.

              Your OpenShift username is the email address associated with the
              Google account you use to log in to the cluster. If you do not
              wish to list email addresses in this issue (which is public), you
              may reach out directly to an operate-first team member to provide
              that information.

              this list: https://github.com/operate-first/support/blob/main/docs/quotas.md

              If none of the tiers are applicable, please choose "custom" and
              specify your requirements (CPU/Memory/Storage) in the next field.

              Please don't be afraid to choose a smaller tier first. If you
              require a higher quota, we can easily upgrade your tier. Quotas
              are here to prevent over-reservation (resource requests) not
              actual usage.

              We store all cluster configuration information in a public git
              repository. Some information, such as email addresses, can be
              considered sensitive.  To keep this information secure, we store
              this information in GPG encrypted files.

              The information about the team members in your `group` will be
              stored in such a file in our configuration repository.  If you or
              your team would like to be able to decrypt your team's encrypted
              OpenShift `group` file then you can provide a GPG key that we will
              include as part of the encryption procedure.

              If you have a GPG key, please provide us with the key fingerprint
              and the name of a keyserver on which it is published. For
              example
