# Open Data Hub on MOC

This repository contains all the operational and user documentation for running the Open Data Hub in MOC.

## Getting Started

We have [Open Data Hub](https://opendatahub.io/) applications deployed and running in a MOC ([Mass Open Cloud](https://massopen.cloud/)) cluster.

The ODH homepage on MOC can be found at [ODH Dashboard](https://odh-dashboard-opf-dashboard.apps.cnv.massopen.cloud/). From there you can access any of the provided application:

### Authenticate via OpenShift

We aim to support authentication via the underlying OpenShift platform for all the components.

Each supported component provides a login button which states "Login via OpenShift" or "Sign in with OpenShift". This will lead you to authentication provider selection screen:

Please select `moc-sso` provider. Then choose the final account provider that fits you the most:
